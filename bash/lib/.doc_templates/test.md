# Introduction

## What is vision?

Human vision is very fast at classification and recognition.
Especially when motion and animals are involved.

Bad at detecting some differences in images, (reflection vs. no-reflection).
Can fall prey to a myriad of optical illusions.

# Computer Vision

## History

Goal: _bridge the gap between pixels and meaning._

Computer Vision started as a summer vision project in 1966 at MIT.
